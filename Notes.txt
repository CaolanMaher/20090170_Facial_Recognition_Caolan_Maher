--------------------------------------------

installed Python 3.8

installed opencv-python

installed opencv-contrib-python for recogniser

got base script to show webcam

made new folder cascades

copied data folder from cv2 and out into cascades folder

made a folder (training_images) for training images

give each person their own folder with their name

put pictures of myself to test the training

made a new script called training.py

script gets all images from the training_images folder,
for each persons folder, an id will be assigned to that person,
then it will go through each image in that folder,
convert them to greyscale, make an array of the grey value (0-255),
do face detection on the image, get the region of interest,
add it to a list for training, and add the id to the labels list

then, using pickle, we output the labels dictionary to a file
to be read in by the app

then, train the recogniser with the training list and the list of labels
